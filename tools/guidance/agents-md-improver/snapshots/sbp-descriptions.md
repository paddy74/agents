### Writing effective descriptions

The `description` field enables Skill discovery and should include both what the Skill does and when to use it.

<Warning>
  **Always write in third person**. The description is injected into the system prompt, and inconsistent point-of-view can cause discovery problems.

  * **Good:** "Processes Excel files and generates reports"
  * **Avoid:** "I can help you process Excel files"
  * **Avoid:** "You can use this to process Excel files"
</Warning>

**Be specific and include key terms**. Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.

Each Skill has exactly one description field. The description is critical for skill selection: Claude uses it to choose the right Skill from potentially 100+ available Skills. Your description must provide enough detail for Claude to know when to select this Skill, while the rest of SKILL.md provides the implementation details.

Effective examples:

**PDF Processing skill:**

```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

**Excel Analysis skill:**

```yaml
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, generate charts. Use when analyzing Excel files, spreadsheets, tabular data, or .xlsx files.
```

**Git Commit Helper skill:**

```yaml
description: Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs. Use when the user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.
```

Avoid vague descriptions like these:

```yaml
description: Helps with documents
```

```yaml
description: Processes data
```

```yaml
description: Does stuff with files
```
